# Week 5 Team Submission - Project Checkpoint

## 1. Summary

**Meeting Date**: February 4, 2026

During this week's team meeting, we focused on infrastructure setup and project planning for the final sprint:

- **Azure Database Setup**: Discussed the process and requirements for setting up Azure SQL Database for the project. Team members who don't have Azure access will receive connection strings and credentials from the team member handling the setup.
- **Task Assignment Planning**: Agreed to assign all remaining project tickets this week to ensure everyone has clear responsibilities for the final push.
- **Project Timeline**: Confirmed our goal to complete all development work by next week.
- **Final Presentation**: Planned to record the final project demonstration next week once all features are implemented.

**Successes**: Team is aligned on timeline and infrastructure approach. Foundation is complete and ready for feature implementation.

**Challenges**: Coordinating Azure access and ensuring all team members can connect to the shared database.

**Next Steps**: Distribute remaining tasks, complete Azure setup, and begin individual feature implementation.

## 4. Project Task

**Task**: Azure SQL Database Setup and Configuration

**Description**: Setting up the cloud database infrastructure for the ServeHub application. This involves creating an Azure SQL Database instance, configuring firewall rules for team access, and distributing connection credentials to team members.

**Challenges**:

- Ensuring all team members without Azure access can still connect to the database
- Securely sharing connection strings without exposing credentials in the repository
- Coordinating IP addresses for firewall configuration across multiple team members

**Functionality**: The Azure database will serve as the central data store for the ServeHub application, hosting user accounts (via ASP.NET Identity), service opportunities, and volunteer registrations. This is critical infrastructure that enables all team members to work with a shared, persistent data source rather than local databases.

**Project Fit**: Database setup is foundational for the application. Without it, team members cannot test authentication, CRUD operations, or any features that require data persistence. This task unblocks all remaining development work.
