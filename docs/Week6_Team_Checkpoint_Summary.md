Week 6 Group Project Checkpoint

# Week 6 Team Submission - Project Checkpoint

## 1. Summary

**Meeting Date**: February 11, 2026

During this week's team meeting, we discussed the concerns with the code, finalized some project bug fixes, and determined another date to record the project.

- **Azure Database Setup**: Discussed the process and requirements for setting up Azure SQL Database for the project. Azure is up and running and we will continue to debug.
- **Task Assignment Planning**: Final bugs with Filtering. Meeting on Monday to record the project and finalize code. WCAG 2.1 guidelines discussed and will need to be implemented. Azure deployment and account setup fixes.
- **Project Timeline**: Fix the rest of the code this week. Plan to be finished by Monday.
- **Final Presentation**: Plan to record the group presentation on Monday.

**Successes**: Our website looks good. The collaboration in the past week had an almost fully functional site and was a great team effort.
**Challenges**: Understanding the technical issues with recording next week. Also, making sure all our individual fixes do not break the code.

**Next Steps**: Submit finished projects.
