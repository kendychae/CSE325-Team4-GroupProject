## 🚀 Getting Started

### Project Initialization (For New Developers)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kendychae/CSE325-Team4-GroupProject.git
   cd CSE325-Team4-GroupProject
   ```
2. **Restore dependencies:**
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code.
   - Run `dotnet restore ServeHub.sln` to restore all NuGet packages.
3. **Database setup:**
   - Update the connection string in `src/ServeHub.API/appsettings.Development.json` as needed for your local SQL Server.
   - Run database migrations (if any) or let the API auto-create the database on first run.
4. **Run the API:**
   - In the terminal: `dotnet run --project src/ServeHub.API/ServeHub.API.csproj`
   - The API will be available at `https://localhost:PORT` (see launchSettings.json for port).
5. **Run the Blazor UI:**
   - In a new terminal: `dotnet run --project ServiceActsAdminUI/ServiceActsAdminUI.csproj`
   - The UI will be available at `https://localhost:5025` (or as configured).
6. **Access the app:**
   - Open your browser to the Blazor UI URL. You should see the home page and be able to navigate.

### User Guide (Basic)

- **Login/Register:** Use the authentication features to create an account and log in.
- **CRUD Operations:** Use the navigation to access, create, update, and delete main entities (e.g., service opportunities).
- **Error Handling:** Friendly error messages will be shown for invalid actions or server errors.
- **Accessibility:** The UI is designed to be accessible and responsive for all users.

### Contributing (For Team Members)

- Always create a new branch for your feature or fix.
- Follow the project board for assigned tasks.
- Write clear code comments and update documentation as needed.
- Test your changes before submitting a pull request.
